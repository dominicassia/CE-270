*This repository consists of labs and homeworks from CE 270 PSU which use Verilog.*

## What is Verilog?
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL), which is different from a software language (SL) such as Python or C++. SLs compile into low level code which tells the hardware what to do in order to achieve the software's task. HDLs are used with chips such as FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), which have reconfigureable internal logic registers. HDLs can configure these registers to act as described in the code, essentially specifying what type of logic gate should be at what register. 

## Coding structures
There are four different techniques to programming a FPGA with Verilog: 
#### Gate Level

#### Data Flow

#### Behaviorial / Algorithmic

#### Switch Level

**This class only previews the first three coding techniques*
