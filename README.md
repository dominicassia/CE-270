## What is Verilog?
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL), which is different from a software language (SL) such as Python or C++. SLs compile into low level code which tells the hardware what to do in order to achieve the software's task. HDLs are used with chips such as FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), which have reconfigureable internal logic registers. HDLs can configure these registers to act as described in the code, essentially specifying what type of logic gate should be at what register.

## Coding Structures
There are four different techniques to programming a FPGA with Verilog, along with some basics.
**This class only previews the first three coding techniques*

### Basic Syntax

##### *Modules*
Verilog views FPGAs as a multitude of 'modules', which act in a similar fashion to functions in a software language. It is common in computer engineering to simplify devices to block diagrams, i.e. taking a top down view of all components. A module functions as a block which takes input, completes a process, and delivers output. Inside said module is where the following structures can be implemented to produce output. 

``` verilog
module my_module(input_1 input_2, my_output);
...
endmodule
```

It is important to keep in mind that modules are general structures that can be reused, and implemented inside of and adjacent to other modules.

##### *Wires* 
Wires are a fundamental concept used in verilog. A wire's simple purpose within Verilog is to make a connection between two devices, whether that be logic gates, flip-flops, etc. Declaring a wire goes as follows:

``` verilog
wire wire_1, wire_2;
```

A wire can be used to feed the output of two modules into another module. This application may be practical in designing a counter. In this example, we can assume we receive input 1 through 4 and output OUTPUT. 

``` verilog
// Define wires
wire wire_1, wire_2;

// Define module 1
module m_1(input_1, input_2, wire_1);
...
endmodule

// Define module 2
module m_2(input_3, input_4, wire_2);
...
endmodule

// Define module 3
module m_3(wire_1, wire_2, OUTPUT);
...
endmodule
```

### Gate Level
This coding style is the most fundamental way of programming a FPGA. Gate level coding is essentially describing each gate needed within the chip, along with assigning connecting wires. Declaring a two input AND gate goes as follows:

``` verilog
and my_and_gate(my_output, input_1, input_2);
```

Declarations of other gate varieties follow the same pattern.
